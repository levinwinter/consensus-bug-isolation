# consensus-bug-isolation

do we even need the message fields or are the verbs enough

window-based approach
- Mazurkiewicz traces
- find cited work
- analysis of execution
- code smell

mvn eclipse:eclipse

- river in python
- which predicates would identify the different bugs
  - liveness saftey us
  - liveness saftey other paper
  - martijn
- communication clojure
- depending in which order i receive validations

do we need anything related to orderings?
with what do we keep quorum?
capture orderings of patterns?

how do we handle messages that are too late?
-> give predicates

- what kind of invariants do they have in the paper? https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/public/i4.pdf
- share list of literature review
